Functional dependency linking
=============================

Apart from parent-child relationships, devices (consumers) often have
functional dependencies on other devices (suppliers). Common examples of
suppliers are clock, regulators, pinctrl, etc. However not all of them are
dependencies with well defined devicetree bindings. Also, not all functional
dependencies are mandatory as the device might be able to operate in a limited
mode without some of the dependencies.

The depends-on property allows marking these mandatory functional dependencies
between one or more devices. The depends-on property is used by the consumer
device to point to all its mandatory supplier devices.

Optional properties:
- depends-on:	A list of phandles to mandatory suppliers of the device.


Examples:
Here, the device is dependent on only 2 of the 3 clock providers
dev@40031000 {
	      compatible = "name";
	      reg = <0x40031000 0x1000>;
	      clocks = <&osc_1 1>, <&osc_2 7> <&osc_3 5>;
	      depends-on = <&osc_1>, <&osc_3>;
};
