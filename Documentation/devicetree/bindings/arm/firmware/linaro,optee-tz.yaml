description: |
  OP-TEE is a piece of software using hardware features to provide a Trusted
  Execution Environment. The security can be provided with ARM TrustZone, but
  also by virtualization or a separate chip.

  We're using "linaro" as the first part of the compatible property for
  the reference implementation maintained by Linaro.

properties:
  $nodename:
    const: optee

  compatible:
    const: linaro,optee-tz

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1
    description: |
      This interrupt which is used to signal an event by the secure world
      software is expected to be edge-triggered.

  method:
    enum: [smc, hvc]
    description: |
      The method of calling the OP-TEE Trusted OS depending on smc or hvc
      instruction usage.
      SMC #0, register assignments
      or
      HVC #0, register assignments
      register assignments are specified in drivers/tee/optee/optee_smc.h

  interrupt-controller: true

  "#interrupt-cells":
    const: 1
    description: |
      OP-TEE exposes irq for irp chip controllers from OP-TEE world. Each
      irq is assigned a single line number identifier used as first argument.
      Line number identifiers and their meaning shall be found in the OP-TEE
      firmware platform documentation.
